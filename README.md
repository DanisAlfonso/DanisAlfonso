# Welcome to Danis Alfonso's GitHub Repository

Hello there! I'm Danis Alfonso, and this is my GitHub repository. Here, I document my journey into the world of programming, data analysis, 3D, and AI. Feel free to explore my projects, provide feedback, and collaborate if you're interested in any of the topics I'm passionate about.

## About Me

- 👨‍💻 I'm currently learning **C++** to deepen my understanding of programming and algorithms.
- 📚 I'm working on creating a scientific library for numerical computation to apply what I've learned and contribute to the community.
- 📱 I'm also interested in **SwiftUI** and its potential for creating beautiful, user-friendly iOS and macOS applications.
- 📊 Data Analysis is one of my favorite domains, and I'm constantly exploring data-driven insights and visualization techniques.
- 🌐 I have a fascination with **3D** modeling and rendering, and I'm excited to explore the creative possibilities in this field.
- 🤖 My curiosity extends to the realm of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, where I aim to develop smart and innovative solutions.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects you can find in this repository:

- **Numerical Computation Library:** I'm building a library for numerical computation in C++. You'll find various algorithms, mathematical functions, and utility tools to aid in scientific computing.
